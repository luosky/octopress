The Road Not Taken

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,   
And sorry I could not travel both   
And be one traveler, long I stood   
And looked down one as far as I could   
To where it bent in the undergrowth;   
  
Then took the other, as just as fair,   
And having perhaps the better claim   
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;   
Though as for that, the passing there   
Had worn them really about the same,   
  
And both that morning equally lay   
In leaves no step had trodden black.   
Oh, I marked the first for another day!   
Yet knowing how way leads on to way   
I doubted if I should ever come back.   
  
I shall be telling this with a sigh   
Somewhere ages and ages hence:   
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,   
I took the one less traveled by,   
And that has made all the difference.   


黄叶林中分出两条小路，  
可惜我一人不能同时涉足，  
我在路口伫立良久，  
向着其中一条翘首极目，  
直到它消失在丛林深处。  
  
但我选择了另一条路，  
芳草待踏，分外幽寂，  
同样显得诱人，美丽，  
显然这两条路是如此相似，  
都几乎没有旅人的足迹。  
  
那天清晨落叶满地，  
两条都是未经脚步踩踏的小径，  
呵，留下一条路等下次再走，  
但我知道路径蜿蜒没有尽头，  
恐怕一走就再难回首。  
  
也许多少年后在某地，  
我回首往事轻声叹息，  
两条道路分散在树林里  
而我选择的那条更少人迹，  
从此决定了我人生的迥异
