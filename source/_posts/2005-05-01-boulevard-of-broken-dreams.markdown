Boulevard Of Broken Dreams

by Green Day

I walk a lonely road   
The only one that I have ever known   
Don't know were it goes   
But it's home to me and I walk alone 

I walk this empty street   
On the boulevard of broken dreams   
Where the city sleeps   
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

I walk alone, I walk alone  
I walk alone an' I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me   
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating   
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Til then I walk alone 

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh   
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah 

I'm walking down the line   
That divides me somewhere in my mind   
On the border line of the edge   
And where I walk alone 

Read between the lines what's   
Fucked up and everything's all right   
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive   
And I walk alone 

I walk alone, I walk alone   
I walk alone an I walk a 

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me   
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating   
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Til then I walk alone 

Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ahhh   
Ah-Ah Ah-Ah Ah-Ah 

I walk alone an' I walk a  
I walk this empty street   
On the boulevard of broken dreams   
Where the city sleeps   
And I'm the only one and I walk a

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me   
My shallow hearts the only thing that's beating   
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Til then I walk alone

Have you ever felt some kind of emptiness inside 
You will never measure up, to those people you 
Must be strong, can't show them that you're weak 
Have you ever told someone something 
That's far from the truth 
Let them know that you're okay 
Just to make them stop 
All the wondering, and questions they may have 

I'm okay, I really am now 
Just needed some time, to figure things out 
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you 
Still we don't know what's yet to come 

Have you ever seen your face, 
In a mirror there's a smile 
But inside you're just a mess, 
You feel far from good 
Need to hide, 'cos they'd never understand 
Have you ever had this wish, of being 
Somewhere else 
To let go of your disguise, all your worries too 
And from that moment, then you see things clear 

I'm okay, I really am now 
Just needed some time, to figure things out 
Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you 
Still we don't know what's yet to come
