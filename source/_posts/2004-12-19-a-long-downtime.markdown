## A Long Downtime

##### 2004/12/19 11:00:30

This weekend ALL EQ2 servers have been down for over 24hours without any solid ETA. And Crushbone has been down for over 36hours... All characters have been rolled back to 7AM PST, Dec 17. Many ppl suspect that the reason of the loooong downtime is hacking or exploit.

But someone said: They are using this downtime to power play our characters as fast as they can and get them all back up to level and with the equipment we had.

lol
