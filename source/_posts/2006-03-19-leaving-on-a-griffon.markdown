All my bags are packed, I'm ready to go  
I'm standing here outside your door, I hate to wake you up to say good-bye  
But the dawn is breakning, it's early morn  
The taxi's waiting, he's blowing his horn  
Already I'm so lonesome I could die  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
'Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh Babe, I hate to go  
  
There's so many times I've let you down  
So many times I've played around  
And I tell you now, they don't mean a thing  
Every place I go I'll think of you  
Every song I sing I'll sing for you  
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring  
  
So kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
'Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh Babe, I hate to go  
  
Now the time has come to leave you  
One more time, oh, let me kiss you  
And close your eyes and I'll be on my way  
Dream about the days to come  
When I won't have to leave alone  
About the times that I won't have to say  
  
Oh, kiss me and smile for me  
Tell me that you'll wait for me  
Hold me like you'll never let me go  
'Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh Babe, I hate to go  
  
I'm leaving on a jet plane  
I don't know when I'll be back again  
Oh Babe, I hate to go  
  
'Cos I'm leaving on a jet plane  
Leaving on a jet plane  
Leaving on a jet plane  
Leaving on a jet plane  
Leaving on a jet plane  
Leaving on a jet plane
